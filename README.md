What I Learned
This project helped me enhance my understanding of responsive design and layout implementation using CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also focused on creating an intuitive user interface for news content, ensuring that the layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. Below is a snippet of my HTML structure for managing layout:


<div class="hero-image col-md-5 text-center order-0 order-md-1">
  <img src="./images/image-hero-desktop.png" alt="News Illustration" class="img-fluid hero-image-size">
</div>
<div class="hero-text col-md-7 text-center text-md-start order-1 order-md-0">
  <h1 class="display-4"><b>Stay Updated</b></h1>
</div>


The use of order-0 and order-md-1 allows me to swap the content order based on screen size, ensuring a mobile-first responsive layout.

Continued Development
I plan to continue refining my skills in responsive web design and JavaScript interactivity. In future projects, I want to focus on improving accessibility and ensuring compatibility with older browsers, while also adding more interactive features like dynamic news feeds.
